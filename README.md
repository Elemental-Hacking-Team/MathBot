# MathBot
Project for Hackable 2021

Principal files: 

- kivi.py -> Main code for the project
- my.kv -> kivy structure and style
- backend.py -> python funcitons used in the main code

## Inspiration
Our inspiration is to solve the education problem that exist in children from the Middle East.

## What it does
Teaches the definition of basic mathematical concepts, and numerical fractions. 

## How we built it
We use Kivy framework library to create the application and python to create the content and information of the application. 

We used libraries like:
- gTTS and playsound for speech generation.
- re and nltk for text processing.
- matplotlib to generate fraction graphics.  

## Challenges we ran into
- Creating the application using Kivy.
- Generating text to speech for the definition of concepts.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating the entire application using Kivy.

## What we learned
Creating applications using Kivy, generating sppech form text.

## What's next for MathBot
Make a better looking interface.
Creating a full virtual mathematical assistant for more concepts and topics (angles, geometry, etc.).
Use it as a base to teach any topic (sicence, language, arts, etc.).
